It's easy to style shell commands and their outputs.
Here's a one-line command and a one-line output.

{% include shell.html cmd='echo 1' out='1' %}

You can pass multiple commands and multi-line output to the include as well:

{% include shell.html cmd='echo 1
echo 2' out='1
2' %}

However, it is recommended that you `capture` multi-line commands and outputs
into variables and pass them.
This is mostly because Liquid doesn't like backslashes too much.

{% capture cmd1 %}
touch test.txt && \
    echo 123 >> test.txt && \
    echo 456 >> test.txt && \
    cat test.txt
{% endcapture %}
{% capture out1 %}
123
456
{% endcapture %}

{% include shell.html cmd=cmd1 out=out1 %}

You can display multiple commands one after another.

{% include shell.html cmd="printf 'Hello\n'" out='Hello' %}
{% include shell.html cmd="printf 'World\n'" out='World' %}

Only the last one will have a bottom margin.

Also, here's a really long command with a really long output:

{% capture cmd1 %}
printf '%s\n' 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'
{% endcapture %}
{% capture out1 %}
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
{% endcapture %}

{% include shell.html cmd=cmd1 out=out1 %}

This is ugly though, so please don't do that.

Commands don't necessarily have to have output:

{% include shell.html cmd='mkdir test' %}
{% include shell.html cmd='cd test' %}
