Snippets are defined in exactly the same way as in the [other post].
Just set a front matter value to make them collapsible, and voil√†!

[other post]: {{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-04-09-snippets %}

{% include jekyll-theme/snippets/section.html section_id='hello' %}

This is another set of snippets:

{% include jekyll-theme/snippets/section.html section_id='world' %}
