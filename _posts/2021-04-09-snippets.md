It's pretty simple, just use the corresponding include:

{% include snippets/section.html section_id='hello' %}

This is another set of snippets:

{% include snippets/section.html section_id='world' %}

You can insert a code snippet using the regular Markdown syntax without any
highlighting:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -o errexit -o nounset -o pipefail

main() {
    echo "Hello, world!"
}

main
```

Also, some inline code: `./test.sh`!
