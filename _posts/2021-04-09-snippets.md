It's pretty simple, just use the corresponding include:

{% include jekyll-theme/snippets/section.html section_id='hello' %}

This is another set of snippets:

{% include jekyll-theme/snippets/section.html section_id='world' %}

Of course, you can insert a code snippet using the regular Markdown syntax
without any highlighting:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -o errexit -o nounset -o pipefail

main() {
    echo "Hello, world!"
}

main
```

The same with highlighting enabled:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -o errexit -o nounset -o pipefail

main() {
    echo "Hello, world!"
}

main
```

Also, some inline code: `./test.sh`!

Here's a snippet which requires a horizontal scrollbar to display, it should
look OK:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA What a long snippet
```
